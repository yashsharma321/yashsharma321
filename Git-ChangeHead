I have created a branch from master, it was a mistake, I had to create a new branch from a feature branch 'SFVS-5204'. I can delete the newly created branch and re-create it from the feature branch SFVS-5204, or there any way just change the head of the newly created branch in git ??

Yes, you can change the HEAD of the newly created branch without deleting and recreating it. Here's how you can fix this in Git:

Steps to change the branch's HEAD:
Checkout the newly created branch (the one you mistakenly created from master):

git checkout <new-branch>
Reset the HEAD of the new branch to the SFVS-5204 branch using the --hard option:
git reset --hard SFVS-5204
This will move the new-branch to point to the same commit as the SFVS-5204 branch.

Explanation:
The git reset --hard SFVS-5204 command effectively repositions the new-branch's HEAD to the same commit as SFVS-5204. The --hard option means that it also updates your working directory and index to match this commit.
Note: If you've made any changes in the new-branch that you want to preserve, you might want to stash them first with git stash before running git reset --hard, and then apply the stash after resetting.

If you donâ€™t want to affect your working directory, you could also use a soft or mixed reset:

Soft reset (preserves working directory and index):

git reset --soft SFVS-5204
Mixed reset (preserves working directory, resets index):

git reset --mixed SFVS-5204
